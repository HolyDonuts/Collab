TurnTale is a collaborative story writing site.

Users can sign up (email address is just for unique validation in dB) and login

User can create new stories and share their story ID with other users who can join in.

Users take turns to add as much to the story as they want (current limit 200 words), before submitting their entry and passing the turn on to the next user.

There is no limit on the amount of users who can join a story.

Users only see their full entries. All other user's entries will be blurred except for the last sentence which will be visible as a prompt for them to continue on from.

Currently there is no "end", instead users can select "show full story" to view the full story when they are done.

That's about all the logic so far.
